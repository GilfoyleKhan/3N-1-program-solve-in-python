-------------!!!OUTPUT OF THIS PROGRAM!!!-------------                             |
numc is a variable for user to insert positive integers.                           |
Then numc variable goes to threen() function as a parameter.                       |
===================================================================================|
If numc or user insert 1,the  output of the program is 1                           |
********Your number that you just insert is >>numc<<                               |
===================================================================================|
If numc or user insert even number,the  output of the program                      |
is lines of number that has been multiply by 3 and                                 |
plus 1(numc*3+1) and divided 2(numc/2)                                             |
****Your number that you just insert is >>numc<<                                   |
===================================================================================|
If numc or user insert odd number,the  output of the program                       |
is lines of number that has been multiply by 3 and                                 |
plus 1(numc*3+1) and divided 2(numc/2)                                             |
****Your number that you just insert is >>numc<<                                   |
